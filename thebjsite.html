        Well hello there humans! My name is BJ. I grew up in the faraway land of Dallas, Texas, though I was born in Los Angeles, California, the land of bacon wrapped hot dogs. I moved to Colorado about 3 years ago and most of my time since has been spent working
        at a gym watching people lift stuff and then put it back down. I have two cats, Hobbes and Zoey. You can find an objectively adorable picture of Hobbes and I <a href="https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/calvin-and-hobbes.jpg?quality=100&w=650&h=445">here</a>.
